# Covid-19-Tracker

## Description

1. This Covid-19-Tracking Application is a very useful tool. It's designed for users who need a quick check for coronavirus cases around the world. The application has a clean user interface and provides a simple user experience.

2. When the user inputs a location, they just simply choose a category:

   - Country
   - Province
   - City/County

3. After clicking on the search button, the dashboard will then display the current Covid-19 details for that location.

4. Error handling:

   - If the user forgets to type a location before clicks the search button, a message will show up to remind the user there is no input.
   - If the user forgets to select a category, the search button will not search and no data will show up.
   - If the user inputs a location that is not in the database, a message will remind the user the input is not found.

5. After each search, the location is saved and stored on the left-side history column. The user can click on it later anytime, to get the most recent Covid-19 data globally. The user can delete each save search or delete all history by clicking on the red buttons.

6. This application can save multiple locations as tabs, the user doesn't need to type the searched inputs again.

7. The Covid-19 map on the right side of the web page has tooltips that can show data when the curser hovering over. The Covid-19 tests chart will provide more info about each country.
